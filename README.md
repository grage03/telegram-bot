# Introduction

The idea of writing this bot came to me during my admission to the University. I thought about the fact that I have no place to store information about universities. Yes, of course I could create a pdf file and store all the information there, but it's boring :)

# How it all works?

Initially, there are 2 commands, such as `/adduniversity` and `/university`. The first adds the University to the list, the second displays a list of all universities.

# Database structure

The database is built as simply as possible, there is one table that stores information about universities.
